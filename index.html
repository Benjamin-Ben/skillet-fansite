                <h2>Christian group</h2>
                <p>With a blend of heavy electric guitar, keyboards, and strong melodies, Skillet resembles a heavy metal band, but promotes a Christian message. The band, which has been compared to Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson, "rocks pretty hard compared to the average Christian radio band," according to Terry Deboer in the Grand Rapids Press. The band includes John Cooper, guitar and vocals; his wife Korey Cooper on vocals and keyboards; Lori Peters on drums; and Ben Kasica on keyboards. The group has had eight songs in the number one slot on Christian radio and has been nominated for eleven Dove Awards.</p>


                <p class="read-text">The band's founder, John Cooper, grew up in a conservative Christian home, where his parents enforced rules about the music he was allowed to listen to. They favored wholesome singer Amy Grant, but Cooper was more interested in hearing the Christian rock band Stryper, who emulated the heavy metal sound, and he liked the bizarre costumes and makeup of the hardcore mainstream band Kiss. He had to sneak over to friends' houses to hear Stryper, because his parents would not allow him to play their music in their home. Even when Stryper won the highest award in Christian music, the Dove Award, his parents refused to let him watch the awards on television, saying the costumed band members were demons. In addition to Stryper, Cooper also liked White Cross, Skid Row, and other bands.</p>
